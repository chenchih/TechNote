# My Pytest Note 

## Update Status
- 2024.07.19 inital update 

## Intoduction
In this page I would like to share on some of basic example of using pip test. 

## Basic Understanding of pytest 
### Install module 
> Install pytest module or libary
>> `pip install pytest`

Pytest is a powerful framework on automation, which allow you to run testcase. 
### define test case:
- Each file each function name with test will be an testcase, like:
```
def test_hello():
	print("helloworld")
```

### How to run Test case
#### cli command 

- File naming convention:
	- File name with `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` will automatic run your testcase 
	> running testcase: `pytest [option -v|s|rp|k] test_file.py` 

**Note:** If you don't assign your testfile.py name, then wheny you use pytest all the test will be execute in current directory. 

#### Flag and option
When we run with pytest we can add some flag or option, if not add will not display test result information. 

| Flag | Description | example/command |
| :-- | --: |:--:|
| `-v` or `--verbose`  | Provide more detail about test exection | pytest -v file.py |
| `-s` or `--nocapture`  | Prints standard output of your test cases by default will not display  on console only fail will display| pytest -s file.py |
| ::  | Run specfic testcase| pytest -v file.py::testcase |
| `-q` or `--quiet`  | show only failure, summary, and errors| pytest -q file.py |
| `-k` or `--keyword`  | Select tests base on keyword exoression, or matcing keyword will run| pytest -k <substring> file.py |
| `-m` or `--marker`  | Seelct group test base on marker | pytest -m <marker tag> file.py |

#### IDE Setting
We can also use IDE editor to run pytest, I will show using VSCODE and Pycharm as example. 

- VScode Setting
You can click on "Testing" on the left sidebar navigator, click on configure setting, and select pytest and your project name.
This setting will use the default setting, if you wants to use the argument of pytest flag, please access to this setting: 
	- (Method1)go to `settings`>`Workspace`>`TextEditor`>edit in `settings.json` 
	- (Method2)go to `settings`>`Workspace`>click on the top right side `open settings` 
	- (Method3) press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type in `open workspace settings (json)`>TextEditor>edit in `settings.json` 
Add below into the setting, and `["."]` add your flag like 
```
{
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": ["--verbose",
								"--exitfirst",
								""test/",
								// more ..],
  "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
  "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    
  }
}

- Pycharm Setting
	- go to setting>search for `integrate tool` or under `Tools`> `Python Integrated tool` 
	- In testing section change `default` to `pytest`
	- To add argument please click on three dot beside setting, and press `edit`
	- Please refer photo below for more detail

#### Pytest configure
You can refer to this [site](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/reference/customize.html) on more information to set pytest configure. 

If you don't like to use the IDE, or Option, then you can choose to add inside the pytest configure file with `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml`, and etc.
This is my pytest.ini, you can refer my file:
```
[pytest]
addopts = -vs
markers =
    windows: mark test as windows-specificrrr
    nonwindows: mark test as non-windows
filterwarnings =
    error
    ignore::UserWarning
```


## Fixture 
Reusable blocks of code that handle specific testing needs like setting up environments, providing mock data, or cleaning up resources (teardown).
You will often use for setup or teardown

- Syntax: `@pytest.fixture`

```
import pytest
@pytest.fixture
def setup():
    print("Lanuch Browser")
    print("Login")
    print("Browser Product")
    yield
    print("Logout")
    print("Close browser")
    
def testAllitemtoChart(setup):
    print("Login Success")

def removeItemfromChart():
    print("Logout Success")
```

Example file will use:,`test_dbFixture.py`, `test_db.py`,`mydb.py`
## conftest
The purpose of using conftest is because of reusing the function, or if you have many test, and not wanting to write setup or tear down function, then you can write it in the conftest. 

In the fixture example you have write setup in this case will move the setup into a new file`conftest.py` 

> Snyntax:


You can also add option `autouse=True` inside fixture. This mean all the test will default read confest.py. 
Without this option, you need to pass your setup function to fixture
```
import pytest
#adding fixture without autouse=True
@pytest.fixture
def setup():
	pass

def test_without_autouse(setup):
	pass

#enable autosue=True
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def setup():
	pass

def test_with_autouse():
	pass

```

From above example if you add `autouse=True` then you no need to pass in function into your test case function. This means no matter you pass in or not it will always read the confest.py. 


> - test_fixtureexample.py
```
def testAllitemtoChart():
    print("Login Success")

def testremoveItemfromChart():
    print("Logout Success")

def test_hello():
    print("Hello World")
```

> - `conftest.py`

```
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def setup():
    print("Lanuch Browser")
    print("Login")
    print("Browser Product")
    yield
    print("Logout")
    print("Close browser")
```

Now when you run it will read the conftest.py and run the setup

### understand scope 
The default scoope is `function`, there are couples of scope:
- `function`: default scope, fixture is destroy at the end of the test 
- `clas`: fixture is destroy during teardown of the last test in the class
- `module`: fixture is destory during teardown od the test in module
- `package`: fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package`
- `session`: fixture is destory at the end of the test session`

So in the above I use the default scope, since I didn't assin it. You can assign like this:ã€€`pytest.fixture(scope="function",autouse=True)`
In the fucntion scope: all the test will run like `setup`, your test, and `teardown`
In the session scope: each test will run like `setup` test1, test2..., and then `teardown` which mean if you only want to run one time setup and teardown then you can use this.

## parameterized
It allows you to create multiple test cases from a single test function by providing different input values and expected outputs.

-  Reduced Code Duplication: mutiply test case with same logic but different input , you can use parameterized test function.
-  Test Readability: provide clear and concise manner, like test data and expected result
-  Allows for passing different input values



> Syntax: 
```
@pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input, expected_result", 
          [ (value1_for_test_input, value1_for_expected_result),
           (value2_for_test_input, value2_for_expected_result))
 def test_function(test_input, expected_result):
```

> Example file will use:`test_parameter.py`,`string_num.py`

### withour parameterized
> `string_num.py`
```
def greting(name):
    return f"{name}"
def square_calculate(num):
    return num*num
```

>`test_parameter.py`
```
from string_num import greting as greetlib
from string_num import square_calculate as squarelib
                
import pytest
def test_gretting_1():
    name=greetlib("James")
    assert name == "James"
def test_gretting_2():
    name=greetlib("Anna")
    assert name == "Anna"
```

Notice that the test_greeting_1 and test_gretting_2 logic is the same, just the passing Name is different. 
If you have alot of name to test, then you have to keep changing the name or writting more test case function. 
Instead of doing that you can write a parameterized function. 


### with parameterized
```
import pytest

# STRING NAME
@pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input, expected_output",
                         [
                            ("sam", "sam"), 
                            ("john", "john"),
                            ("emily", "emily")
                        ])
def test_greeting(test_input, expected_output):
    name= greetlib(test_input)
    assert name==expected_output
```
This is a better approach instead of writting multiply test case function you can write one function and add the input and expected value on parameterized decorator. 


## Grouping test marker
You can add marker or you can refer it as a tag, and add on top of the testcase. This mean it will run only on the marker you add, and essential this is like testing group of testing like checkbox related.

- Custom Marker: Marker define by you. 
	> run like this: `pytest -v filename.py -m <marker name>
	
- Buult-in marker: pytest marker like `skip`, `skipif`, `xpass`, and etc.
	> show all built-in marker: `pytest --markers`
	> Example of writting a built-in marker:  `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="")`
	
Example file will use:`test_markerOS.py`,`test_markerSkip.py`
